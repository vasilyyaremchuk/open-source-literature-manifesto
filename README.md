# Open Source Literature Manifesto

Let's design the future together!

## Introduction

We propose absolutely new concept of Literature. The artworks of it will be free, flexible, ready for continuous improvement, and with an unlimited lifetime. The novel can follow the new life changes and can be up-to-date and clear for any new generation and it can be better and better with each new version. Everybody can contribute and change the world.

## Background

We are used to taking literary works as something set in stone with the author, final version and publishing date. When you were young you can imagine the other final of your favorite story...

But there is another example, these are folk tales, which have different versions and were created by many people.

We are inspired by the success of Open Source's approach to software development and are confident that it can be extrapolated to other areas of life.

Literature could be a good option to try it, because it's a text like we have in the most cases of software development. We have a lot of colaboration tools, for example Git, that can be borrowed to work with a Literature projects.

We just need to set a basic rules.

## Manifesto

1. The best in this world for free. If you are going to contribute you should be ready to provide your results to everybody for free without any restriction.
2. Collaboration and competition. You can either provide to the person ability to collobarate and to contribute in your project inside your rules and workflow or give them the ability to fork (take for the initial state) your current or any previous version of your art work to start their own project with their rules and workflow.
3. Attribution. You must have a history of all changes and all individual contributions including contribution history of your the project that was taken as the initial point of your artwork.
4. Infinit project livetime and infinit development process. Any Open Literature projecct can't be closed of freesed. If you don't want or don't have the ability to continue it, you can find a new maintainer and not prevent any futher development of the project.
5. Versions and variants. You can mark some states of your art project with some version labels for the better reffering and some external usage. You can also have some variations of text (branches) inside one project that can developed in parallel.
6. Commercial usage. Any commercial usage of Open Source Literature texts allowed with strict reference to the source text and the link where it could be available for free.    

## Notes and Explanations for the Commercial usage

For example, you can take any Open Source Literature project for the base of your movie plot or theater play, you don't need to pay any royalty, but you must refer to the original source and outline the atribution of the artwork.

## Other usage

There is no any limitation to any other usage of those artworks and Open Source Literature approach. For example, you can play in creation of the novel or story in your team inside the teambuilding process or practice agile, scrum or any other 3rd party metodology.

## Final important note

This Manifesto is also a piece of the Open Source Literature. Welcome to contribute! 

## Conclusion

This concept is something more than just an idea to make something beautiful together. It's the next generation of social media network. Now we have people binded together in social network where they can share their own content. Also, we have some communities that can be united by some idea. But in the case of Open Source Literature artwork people can be united by their own atr product that has significant cultural value.
